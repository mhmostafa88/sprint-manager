Click any of the task objects

popup appears, prompting me to enter the following:

1- how many points completed?
3- description

The app should already know who completed the points.
A new entry ('completed points') to the database should indicate a tasks's completed points ..
..(if the task doesn't exist then create it) and the task id (of the task itself)

This should be followed by calculating the 'Total Completed Points' across the sprint.
